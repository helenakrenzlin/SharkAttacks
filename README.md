. Shark-Resistant Gear Feasibility Analysis

**Overview**

This project analyzes unprovoked shark attack data to assess the feasibility of expanding into shark-resistant protective gear. The analysis supports business decisions related to product design, customer targeting, and marketing strategy.

**Business Objective**

To determine whether data supports investment in shark-resistant gear by analyzing:

* Gender distribution of incidents

* Sport activities with highest exposure

* Common injury patterns and affected body parts

**Hypotheses**

**1.** Most Shark attacks are unprovoke

**2.**Male participants experience more sport-related shark attacks

**3.** Activities beyond surfing require protective gear

**4.** Injuries are concentrated in specific body parts


**Dataset**

Source: Global Shark Attack File (GSAF)

Focus: Unprovoked, sport-related incidents

**Tools Used**

* Python

* Pandas

* Matplotlib

* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

**Key Insights**

* Majority of incidents are unprovoked

* Majority of incidents involve male participants

* Surfing, swimming, and wading dominate exposure

* Lower limbs are the most commonly injured body parts

**Business Recommendations**

**1.** Launch male-focused protective gear initially

**2.** Develop sport-specific product lines

**3.** Prioritize lower-limb protection

**4.** Use data-driven, non-fear-based marketing
